Below is the sample output for the Snakes and Ladders game.
Initially the layout of the game board is shown which  contains total 120 cells. Each numbered cell has its co-ordinate position shown below in brackets.
Co-ordinate positions of snakes and ladders are also displayed. Co-ordinates on the left side of the arrow indicate mouth (of snake) / start (of ladder).
Correspondingly co-ordinates on the right hand of the arrow indicate tail end (of snake) / end (of ladder).
Player1 starts the game by rolling the dice.
Each time dice is rolled, co-ordinate positions of the players are updated. Updated co-ordinate positions for each player are displayed.
While moving the players, to new positions, if ladder or snake is found in the updated position after dice throw, accordingly the player will scale up or slide down the board.
This change is reflected in position of the player.
Finally the player who reaches the end cell (1, 10) wins the game.
